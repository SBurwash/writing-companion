AI, AI, AI. It’s the topic of the hour, the favourite subject of conversation around the data table. Move aside politics and religion; there’s a new controversial conversation topic in town.

It’s hard to fully grasp the extent to which the advent of LLMs, and by extension agents, will impact our day-to-day lives. Will AI be taking our jobs? The recent waves of layoffs from Meta and Microsoft certainly seem to suggest so. However, much like the role of a bank teller or an assembly line worker, the real story isn’t just job loss; it’s job transformation. I suspect the nature of our work will fundamentally change to adapt to this new reality.

Of course, consultancies must also adapt. As companies prepare for this new AI world, consulting firms must shift their approach to meet the new reality of shorter deadlines and an intense focus on return on investment (ROI). Gone are the days of purely technical implementation — now it’s all about delivering value.

So when you are shopping for your next technical partner to guide you into this new age of AI, Agents, LLMs, and chatbots, how should you go about it? What skills should you be looking for, and what should you try to avoid?

To answer that, here is a playbook for evaluating your next data partner, based on the qualities that matter most in the AI era.

The New Playbook: Qualities of a Modern Data Partner
====================================================

Skill #1 — Staying Ahead of the Curve
-------------------------------------

The world is moving faster and faster, and stragglers get left behind.

A good implementation partner is one that is constantly ahead of the curve, innovating, researching, and acting upon new trends and ideas.

The tell-tale signs to look for:

*   Are they up-to-date on the latest technologies and best practices?
*   Do they actively participate in thought leadership (articles, conferences, etc.)?
*   Do they go beyond only “having heard of” a specific technology, providing insights into implementation, security & cost management strategies?

Skill #2 Driving Tangible Value
-------------------------------

As agents [accelerate delivery speed](https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/how-cursor-grows) and provide companies with more tools to implement solutions in-house, there is an increased focus for partners to demonstrate **clear value add** as opposed to simply showcasing the work achieved.

The tell-tale signs to look for:

*   Do they have a proven track record of generating value for clients?
*   Are they results-driven?
*   Are they flexible in their implementation approach to provide a solution tailored to your needs?

Skill #3: Building Rapport & True Collaboration
-----------------------------------------------

![I had to Google how to draw stickmen for this. Believe it or not, this actually demonstrates effort.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:930/format:webp/1*EjyQuo7q18D8YycpL8rqnA.png)

Choosing a partner is a significant financial investment — You want to make sure that they not only understand the technical requirements of your project, but also the intent and YOUR ultimate business goals.

Good collaboration is built on trust and a common understanding of each other’s objectives — A great partner should be able to build rapport with you and make sure they deliver on what your company needs.

The tell-tale signs to look for:

*   Do they have a deep understanding of your company’s specific needs?
*   Are they curious not only about your immediate goals, but also about your larger vision and long-term objectives?
*   Do they constantly communicate & make you feel like a priority?

Bonus Skill: Expertise in Governance & Fundamentals
---------------------------------------------------

![Innovation is built on the foundation of strong fundamentals](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*aZQm6Gt7tkXxoRBe6_w91w.png)

With the rising popularity of LLMs, there is an increased requirement for strong fundamentals (data modelling, infrastructure management & architecture).

This is especially true for **data governance**, as agents are incredibly susceptible to bad data quality. Implementing a good data governance foundation will enable you to truly leverage your company’s internal data to reach new productivity heights.

To look out for: Tool-based expertise
-------------------------------------

![Hard to know what to do when your partner only gives you half the solution you need](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*AZ4DxauNOpsGFWqM6ShwJQ.png)

Expertise in the technical implementation of a specific tool will become less and less important as it becomes easier to become “good enough” using LLM-based services.

**What to look out for:**

*   They can only implement a specific product, not an end-to-end solution.
*   They offer a static, out-of-the-box implementation of a service that does not take your company’s specific situation into account.

So when you’re choosing your next partner to implement your data strategy, remember that the criteria have changed. The old markers of competence — certifications and mastery of a single tool — are fading in relevance. The new era demands more.

It demands a partner who is not just a technician but a strategist, not just a vendor but a collaborator. Look for the innovators who stay ahead of the curve, the pragmatists who are obsessed with delivering value, and the collaborators who build genuine rapport. And ensure they build it all on the non-negotiable foundation of solid data governance.

Ultimately, the right partner won’t just help you navigate the complexities of AI; they will help you build a more intelligent, resilient, and forward-thinking organization ready for whatever comes next.
