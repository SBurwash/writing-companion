# Outline: React AI Agent

*   **Introduction**
    *   AI is the name on the town right now
    *   Lots of talk about the "what", but very little on the "how"
    *   Recently trying to up my article writing game - what better way than to do a tutorial on writing an AI writing assistant?
    *   In this article
        *   AI agent in a nutshell
        *   React AI agent specifically
        *   Libraries, Frameworks & Tools (Langchain, LangGraph & LangSmith)

*   **Understanding AI Agents**
    *   AI Agent -> Insert definition
        *   Comparison to an intern, or well-trained monkey
    *   ReAct (Reason + Act) agent
        *   Definition
        *   Components
            *   Main node (agent)
            *   Tools
        *   Operational process
            *   Query
            *   Planning
            *   Execute
            *   Reflect
            *   Repeat

*   **Setting up the React Environment**
    *   Prerequisites (Node.js, npm/yarn)
    *   Creating a new React application (create-react-app or similar)
    *   Basic project structure

*   **Choosing an AI Model/API**
    *   Overview of available AI models/APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Langchain, custom models)
    *   Considerations for choosing the right model (cost, complexity, functionality)
    *   API key setup and authentication

*   **Building the React UI**
    *   Designing the user interface (input fields, display areas, buttons)
    *   Implementing React components for user interaction
    *   Handling user input and managing state

*   **Integrating the AI Model**
    *   Making API requests to the AI model from React
    *   Handling responses and displaying results
    *   Error handling and loading states

*   **Enhancements and Advanced Features**
    *   Real-time updates and streaming
    *   User authentication and authorization
    *   Customizable agent behavior
    *   Data persistence and storage

*   **Testing and Deployment**
    *   Testing the AI agent's functionality
    *   Deployment options (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)

*   **Conclusion**
    *   Recap of the key steps
    *   Potential future directions and improvements
